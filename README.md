# Html includes with standard javascript

This is a barebones working example of how you can include snippets of HTML into other HTML pages. This might come in handy for things like including headers, footers menu's or sidebars to multiple pages of your website or application at one. In this way for instance, 20 webpages wil embed a single navigation menu which was saved as a reusable piece of code in a seperate text or HTML file.

It takes just a couple of lines of javascript to do this. As a bonus, I've also put a few lines of code that sticks an ".active" css class on the menu item with the name of the currently loaded page! It does this by checking the URL that's actively present in the address bar of your browser.
