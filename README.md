# Html includes with standard javascript

An example of how you can include "snippets" of HTML into other HTML pages. This might come in handy for things like including headers, footers, menu's or sidebars to multiple pages of a website or application. For instance, you can embed **this** into 20 or 30 webpages: a **single top bar navigation menu** which was saved as a reusable piece of code in a seperate text or HTML file. It takes just a couple of lines of javascript to do this.

As a bonus, I've also added a few lines of code that sticks an ".active" css class on the menu item with the name as the currently loaded page. It does this by checking the URL that's actively present in the address bar of your browser.
